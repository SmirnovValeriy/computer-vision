## Computer vision

### Computer Vision course

A computer vision course on Computional Mathematics and Cybernetics Faculty of Moscow State University is held for the 3rd grade students of
the Intellegent Information Techologies department. 
The course consists of lectures and workshops. 

### Tasks

On the workshops students are offered to solve different tasks concerning computer vision. A major part of tasks are dedicated to neural networks.
Students are given from 1 day to 2 weeks to present a solution for each task.
A whole list of tasks is as following:
1. Bayer
2. Bayer+
3. Prokudin-Gorsky
4. Scaling
5. Signs detection
6. Face points
7. Backprop 
8. Birds classification
9. Cars detection
10. Birds segmenatation 
11. Tracking

In the repository you can see solutions to the tasks. All of them are written on Python 3. Read a description for each task.

All tasks description and tests are prepared by [Computer Graphics & Multimedia Laboratory of MSU](graphics.cs.msu.ru).
