# Bayer and Bayer+
In the tasks 1-2 you are offered to implement main functions of linear interpolation of colored images. The description for each function and their implementations are presented in jupyter-notebook **bayer.ipynb**.

You can test the functions using **run.py** and unittests located in the same folder. \
***NB:*** you might have to change python3 interpretator in **run.py** (for example I have changed it to **/home/valeriy/anaconda3/bin/python3**).

A whole task description is available only in Russian. You can find it in **WholeTaskDescription.pdf**
